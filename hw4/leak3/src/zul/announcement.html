    Major maintenance update. Update to ZK 5.0 CE, a more recent version of ZK.
    Better support for resizing the browser window. Support for Primo and Summon.
    Auto-detect Bookmarklet for VUfind.

<p>

    either edition id or description.
<p>
2009/2/6:<br />
    Fixed OCLC Worldcat registry - IP autodetection and Worldcat Registry Search should work again.
<p>
2008/10/24:<br />
    Implemented support for Talis Prism 2.x catalogs.

2008/10/04:<br />
    Implemented support Evergreen, Worldcat, and Vubis catalogs.

    the edition builder is seen as a Virginia Tech user)
<p>
2008/06/13:<br />
    Implemented preferences for context menu.

<p>
2008/06/07:<br />
    Internally updated to ZK framework 3.0.5.

    has not been released, however.
    Various minor cosmetic fixes and added consistency checks.

<p>
2008/04/30:<br />
        Add option to bundle auxiliary DLLs into LibX IE Installer.

        several MB on our server.
<p>
2008/04/27:<br />
        Fixed options settings for Millennium -- you should now be able
        to use all indices as configured by your system 
        by providing their code (e.g., 'm', 'd', etc.).
<p>
2008/04/25:<br />
        New Beta of LibX IE - cues should work now, except for auto-linking.

<p>
2008/03/20:<br />

        Implemented secure updates for FX3 and marked LibX as compatible with it.
        Tested on XP, Vista, Linux.  Has layout issues on MacOSX, to be addressed.
        <p>
        Starting FX3 while old version is installed triggers
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=424107" target="_new">Bug 424107</a> in FF 3.0b4.  Firefox developers say this is a blocking bug, so it should be fixed 
        before FX3 final. 
<p>
2008/03/19:<br />
<ul>
        <li>First draft at support for Firefox 3/FX3. 
            Tested with FF3.0b4. Installing in FX3 should
            work, as do manual updates.</li>

            but shows an error if no testing revision exists.</li>

<p>
2008/02/29:<br />
<ul>
        <li>
        Internal rewrite and substantial updates to auto-detection functionality.
        In particular, bookmarklets should now be detected on all pages with "GET"
        submission forms.  It is now possible to enter entire URLs instead of just
        hostnames.
        </li>
        <li>
        If catalog pages provided "shortcut icon" &lt;link&gt; elements, 
        offer import of images associated with catalogs.
        </li>
        <li>
        Support for Endeca detection.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
2008/02/10:<br />
        Augmented edition consistency check.  A frequent mistake appears to be for
        people to not configure any catalogs.  Show a warning when that happens.
        <br />
        Rearranged the "Edition Is Public"/"Edition Is Endorsed" buttons in "My Editions"
        tab.  Added stronger warning to not make editions public until they are ready.

        Changed catalog detection (mostly internal changes, but let us know if things broke.)
        Support for a cue icon setting separate from edition icon.
        Support for per-catalog icons.
<p>
2008/02/01:<br />
        Added catalog detection for Horizon catalog; also now showing visual
        indication of progress.  Keep in mind that auto-detection is still
        only a 
        <a href="http://libx.org/editionbuilderfaq.html#oclcprofile" target="_new">heuristics.</a>
<p>
2008/01/30:<br />
        Added explanation entry regarding OCLC Worldcat registry search and auto-detection facilities
        to <a href="http://libx.org/editionbuilderfaq.html#oclcprofile" target="_new">Edition Builder FAQ.</a>
        Please read if you're wondering about how these facilities work.
<p>

2008/01/29:<br />
        Fixed false positives in auto-detection of Voyager catalogs.
<p>
2008/01/25:<br />
        Fixed "Ill-formed chrome path" exception that prevented cloning of or working
        on legacy editions that contained http:// paths in their options.
        Please send us email or use the send help feature should such exceptions
        still appear.
<p>
2008/01/20:<br />
        Added more consistency checks for catalogs.
        For instance, if the edition builder detects the URL will not work,
        a warning will appear.
<p>
2007/12/07: we performed a number of updates to the Edition Builder. 
<ul>

<li>
        Options can now be selected via a panel.        
</li>
<li>
        Improved Help Box.
</li>
<li>
        OCLC Worldcat Registry search.  Only useful if your institution has at least one
        well-maintained OCLC profile.
        Note that the OCLC Worldcat Registry does not contain a full set of instructions
        on how to search your catalog, or even who your catalog vendor is.  
        We use it only to initiate a probe of your catalog.
