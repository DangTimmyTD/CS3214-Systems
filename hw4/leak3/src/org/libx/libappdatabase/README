Libapp Database, Feed Publisher, and Libapp Builder Interface

How to deploy:

    1.  cd into editionbuilder/src/org/libx/libappdatabase and run `make`.
        This will compile the java classes and move the class files into 
        WEB-INF/classes/org/libx/libappdatabase/.

    2.  Run 
            make emptyfeeds install
        to create a blank and empty database

        Run
            make allfeeds install
        to restore all feeds into a blank database

    3.  Create a symlink in your tomcat webapps/ directory to your working
		editionbuilder/ directory.

        
    Libapp Builder Interface:
        http://yourserver:8080/editionbuilder/src/zul/libappbuilder.zul

Troubleshooting:

	If you get a security exception, the permissions on either ~/.basex or 
	your DBPATH probably restrict tomcat from reading/writing those files

	If you get an error about not being able to access org.basex.Prop, you
	need to do the following:

		1.	edit /etc/tomcat6/policy.d/50local.policy
		2. 	add the following to the bottom of the file:

		grant codeBase "file:${catalina.base}/webapps/editionbuilder/-" {
			permission java.security.AllPermission;
		};

		3. restart tomcat

Configuration:
    
    Database Location:
        The database location is read from a file .basex usually located in the 
        home directory.  The actual location of the home directory is set in 
        org.basex.core.Prop.HOME, which is initialized from the user.home property.
        We adjust user.home when running the tools from the command line to
        force BaseX to use the database files in WEB-INF/

        In the servlet, we set org.basex.core.Prop.HOME before BaseX starts up.
