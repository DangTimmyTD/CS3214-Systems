This heapdump is from a J2EE application.

I also included a snapshot of the source code.

The system ran out of memory when a different tier failed - in this case, the XML BaseX server
to which it was connected experienced an error.

Find out why it ran out of memory, and suggest a way to fix it.

Hint:

Recall how Java's automatically expands buffers in certain JDK classes.
Either consult JDK sources, or deduce based on their semantics.
