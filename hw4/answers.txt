2.
Judging from the headpdump, the JDK ByteArrayOutputStream is the root of the
issue. At the time of failure, it takes up 94.45% of the memory.  Upon further
investigation I found that a byte[] was filled up with 268,435,472 -1's.  I also
found that the file src/org/libx/libappdatabase/BaseXSessionSupport.java was the only
one that used this specific JDK.  When I inspected the file I found an infinte while
loop in the method receive() that took a ByteArrayOutputStream formatted as an OutputStream from
the private method receive(). Inside the loop it waited for b==0 to be true to break, 
but this would never happen since read() returns -1 if the end of the stream of is reached. So, when 
the end of the input is reach it will return -1 and just keep executing the loop and filling
the array with -1 until it overflows the memory.

To fix this, the condition should be changed to if b == -1.
